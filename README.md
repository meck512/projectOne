<h1>Impulse Concerts</h1>
<h2>Project One created by Mariah Eckrich and Ryan Tuttle</h2>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p> 
This web app will show the user the next five shows for their favorite artists, and give them a hotel recommendation for that area. Impulse Concerts was build using HTML, Materialize's CSS framework, and Javascript. The Ticketmaster API is the backbone for the content, and Hotels API gives us the in town recommendation. Overall this was a fun project, and collaborating as developers for the first time was a good experience. We hope you like it!


The requirements for the project:
- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices - for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
